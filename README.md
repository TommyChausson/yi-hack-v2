Yi-hack-v2 project
===============

Special thanks go to **fritz-smh** : https://github.com/fritz-smh/yi-hack

This Yi-hack-v2 project is totally inspired from its own project.


Purpose
=======

This project is a collection of scripts and binaries file to hack your Xiaomi Yi Ants Camera 2.

![Alt text](yi-v2.png?raw=true "Yi Ants Camera 2")

This camera has the default following features :
* wifi
* motion detection : a video file is generated if a motion have been detected in the last 60 seconds.
* send video data over the network on Chinese servers in the cloud to allow people to view camera data from their smartphone wherever they are.
* setup thanks to a smartphone application.
* local video storage on a SD card
* no RTSP server

This hack includes :
* Base firmware : 2.1.1_20160429113900
* Telnet server activated
* FTP server activated
* Ability to choose voice between Chinese, English and French
* Ability to choose timezone and format of date/time embedded in the video

In early alpha stage :
* Ability to disable Chinese cloud
* Ability to activate RTSP server

Warning about some models that are usable only in China
=======================================================

My camera is a CN model, thus it can't be paired with a smartphone outside China.

Thanks to https://diy.2pmc.net/solved-xiaomi-xiao-yi-ant-home-camera-can-used-china/ an old firmware (2.1.1_20160429113900) is available and make this CN model pairable with an Android device app (http://app.mi.com/detail/75646). It can also be paired with an iOS device if you succeed in installing Yi Home from Chinese App Store (tutorial is coming soon).

The firmware comes from http://yi-version.qiniudn.com/@/familymonitor-h21/2.1.1_20160429113900home


Warning about Dirty Mode
=======================================================

The dirty mode has been made for testing, it activate both rtsp server and original xiaomi script. It's very unstable. 

It cause camera crashing when a switching in night mode or a move is detected (sometimes...). A script is launched to control the camera crashing and reboot it !



Installation on the Yi camera
=============================

The memory card must stay in the camera ! If you remove it, the camera will start without using the hack.

Prepare the memory card
-----------------------

Clone this repository on a computer :

    git clone http://github.com/niclet/yi-hack-v2.git
    
Then, format a micro SD card in fat32 (vfat) format and copy the content of the **yi-hack-v2/sd/** folder at the root of your memory card.

The memory card will so contain :

* home.bin : the official firmware file compliant with CN model
* test : the folder which contains the hack scripts and binaries

Start the camera
----------------

* If plugged, unplug the Yi camera
* Insert the memory card in the Yi camera
* Plug the Yi camera
* Follow instructions to pair with your mobile app. This is only needed the first time.

The camera will start. The led will indicate the current status :
* yellow : camera startup
* blue blinking : network configuration in progress (connect to wifi, set up the IP address)
* blue : network configuration is OK. Camera is ready to use.

How can I know which is the version of a firmware 'home.bin' file ?
===============================================================

Just do : **strings home.bin | grep YUNYI_VERSION**. Example :

    $ strings home.bin | grep YUNYI_VERSION
    YUNYI_VERSION=2.1.1_20160429113900


Use the camera
==============

Telnet server
-------------

The telnet server is on port 23.

No authentication is needed, default user is root.

FTP server
----------

The FTP server is on port 21.

No authentication is needed, you can use anonymous user.

RTSP server
-----------
To activate the RTSP server, you need to modify **test/yi-hack-v2.cfg** and uncomment the line YI\_HACK\_STARTUP\_MODE=MODIFIED

You must also modify **test/wpa_supplicant.conf** to be compliant with your own wifi network.

Please note that when you activate RTSP server, you can't use your mobile app anymore.

During camera startup, the led will indicate the current status :
* yellow : camera startup
* blue blinking : network configuration in progress (connect to wifi, set up the IP address)
* blue : network configuration is OK. Camera is ready to use.
* red : network configuration is KO. You should check your **test/wpa_supplicant.conf** file.

Main stream is available from rtsp://\<IP\>/stream1

A secondary MJPEG stream is also available from rtsp://\<IP\>/stream2

Following **hostmit** suggestion, you can now use **test/v2/scripts/capture.sh** to capture a single frame as a JPG file.


I want more !
=============

For now, it is just a kind of proof of concept. Many work has still to be done.

Coming soon !
=============

Connection to wifi without Android app is in progress.
RTSP server is also in progress, this will be the more important and difficult part.


How it works ?
